CoastTileMono_v2nogroup.m: unfinished code for algorithm without groups (isel), stacking all images at once. Purpose to save computation time.
	Concerns: 
	1\ for cloud detection, the orignal code can remove clouds based on smaller areas, whileas the new code can only remove clouds based on the entire image strip.
	2\ for tidal height retrieval at a point on coastlines, needs a new way to get IDs of relevant images. 
	Need to get ids at each point, might be time consuming. -> contradicts with our purpose of this version.


use matlab/2017b
type ver, check if it has:
Mapping Toolbox
